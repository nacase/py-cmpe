Python convenience functions for computer engineering

These functions are intended to be used in an interactive Python
shell (i.e., like a calculator).

You can import this module in an interactive shell, or alternatively,
you can simply invoke this script and it will launch a basic Python
interactive shell with these functions available in the global namespace.

To update to the latest version of this script, simply run:
